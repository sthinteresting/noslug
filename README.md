# No Slug

This plugin is provided for CJK users.

CJK users usually have some CJK characters in theirs title. 
When generating slug with title, it will be a bit terrible.

This plugin can change omit title from url.
For example, you have a discussion which title is "欢迎使用Flarum",
You will get a url like "/d/233" instead of "/d/233-Flarum".

**Note: this is only a front-end change.**

Feel free to open any issues if you have questions.
